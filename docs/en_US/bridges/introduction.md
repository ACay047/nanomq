# MQTT Data Bridges

Bridging is a way to connect multiple MQTT brokers. This section introduces MQTT over QUIC bridge and MQTT over TCP bridge.

## MQTT over TCP Bridging

This section provides an in-depth guide to configuring MQTT over TCP bridging, explaining the primary configuration parameters and demonstrating a typical `nanomq.conf` file setup. It also introduces how to run NanoMQ with a specified configuration file and test bridging to ensure its successful implementation.

## MQTT over QUIC Bridging

This section introduces the innovative feature of MQTT over QUIC bridging. It emphasizes how this feature enables devices, especially those struggling to integrate an appropriate MQTT over QUIC SDK, to take advantage of the QUIC protocol's benefits in IoT scenarios. 

This section also covers the process to start MQTT over QUIC bridging, from building the module using cmake to configuring the QUIC bridge.
